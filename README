FBPAD
=====

Fbpad is a small and simple linux framebuffer virtual terminal.
It manages many terminals through single-letter tags; each tag can
hold two terminals.  The following table indicates fbpad's key-bindings
(m-k means pressing k, while holding the alt key).

==============  =======================================
key		command
==============  =======================================
m-c		execute a shell (SHELL)
m-m		execute mail program (MAIL)
m-e		execute editor program (EDITOR)
m-x 		switch to tag 'x' (TAGS)
m-j		switch to alt terminal in this tag
m-k		like m-j
m-p		show tag summary
m-o		jump to last tag
m-tab		show next terminal
m-s		create a text screenshot (SCRSHOT)
m-y		redraw terminal
c-m-q		quit fbpad
m-f x		use font x in this terminal
==============  =======================================

SETTING UP
==========

You can edit config.h to configure fbpad.  To get fbpad running you need
to make sure F* point to a valid tinyfont file and SHELL is the
shell you want to execute.  Also the type of fbval_t should match
the framebuffer depth: unsigned char for 8-bit, short for 16-bit and int
for 24/32-bit framebuffers.  Once these are set, you should be able to
start fbpad without problems.

Next you may want to change the list of fbpad tags by changing TAGS.
The background and foreground colors can be changed using FGCOLOR and
BGCOLOR macros, for instance the FGCOLOR of 2 and BGCOLOR of 0 creates
green on black terminals.  Individual colors can be customized by
editing the hex RGB color description of COLOR* macros.  Also SCRSHOT
macro specifies text screenshot location.

If you are want to use fbpad's scrsnap feature, you can edit TAGS_SAVED
to change the list of saved terminals.  Framebuffer memory is saved and
reloaded for these tags, which is very convenient when you are using
programs that change the framebuffer simultaneously, like fbpdf.

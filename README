FBPAD
=====

Fbpad is a small linux framebuffer virtual terminal.  It manages many
terminals through single-letter tags; each tag can hold two terminals.
The following table indicates fbpad's key-bindings (m-k means pressing k,
while holding the alt key).

==============  =======================================
key		command
==============  =======================================
m-c		execute a shell (SHELL)
m-m		execute mail program (MAIL)
m-e		execute editor program (EDITOR)
m-x 		switch to tag 'x' (TAGS)
m-j		switch to alt terminal in this tag
m-k		like m-j
m-p		show tag summary
m-o		jump to last tag
m-tab		show next terminal
m-s		create a text screenshot (SCRSHOT)
m-y		redraw terminal
c-m-q		quit fbpad
==============  =======================================

SETTING UP
==========

To configure fbpad, you should edit config.h.  To get fbpad running
you need to make sure F0 points to a valid tinyfont file and SHELL to
the shell you want fbpad to execute.  Also the type of fbval_t should
match the framebuffer depth: unsigned char for 8-bit, short for 16-bit
and int for 24/32-bit framebuffers.  Once these are set, you should be
able to start fbpad without problems.

Fbpad uses tinyfont files, which can be created using ft2tf program
(http://litcave.rudi.ir/).  The FR, FI and FB macros specify the path
of the tinyfont files for regular, italic and bold fonts.  If FI or FB
is NULL, the regular font is used for italic or bold text.

Next you may want to change the list of fbpad tags by changing TAGS.
FGCOLOR and BGCOLOR macros specify foreground and background colors,
for instance the FGCOLOR of 2 and BGCOLOR of 0 creates green on black
terminals.  Individual colors can be customized by editing the hex RGB
color description of COLOR* macros.  Also SCRSHOT macro specifies where
fbpad text screenshots, as created using "m-s" command, should be saved.

If you are want to use fbpad's scrsnap feature, you can edit TAGS_SAVED
to change the list of saved terminals.  Framebuffer memory is saved and
reloaded for these tags, which is very convenient when you are using
programs that change the framebuffer simultaneously, like fbpdf.
